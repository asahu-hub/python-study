# # Association rule mining
# 
# In this notebook, you'll implement the basic pairwise association rule mining algorithm.
# 
# To keep the implementation simple, you will apply your implementation to a simplified dataset, namely, letters ("items") in words ("receipts" or "baskets"). Having finished that code, you will then apply that code to some grocery store market basket data. If you write the code well, it will not be difficult to reuse building blocks from the letter case in the basket data case.

import sys
print(f"=== Python version ===\n{sys.version}")


# ## Problem definition
# 
# Let's say you have a fragment of text in some language. You wish to know whether there are association rules among the letters that appear in a word. In this problem:
# 
# - Words are "receipts"
# - Letters within a word are "items"
# 
# You want to know whether there are _association rules_ of the form, $a \implies b$, where $a$ and $b$ are letters. You will write code to do that by calculating for each rule its _confidence_, $\mathrm{conf}(a \implies b)$. "Confidence" will be another name for an estimate of the conditional probability of $b$ given $a$, or $\mathrm{Pr}[b \,|\, a]$.

# ## Sample text input
# 
# Let's carry out this analysis on a "dummy" text fragment, which graphic designers refer to as the [_lorem ipsum_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum):

# **Exercise 0** (ungraded). Look up and read the translation of _lorem ipsum_!

# **Data cleaning.** Like most data in the real world, this dataset is noisy. It has both uppercase and lowercase letters, words have repeated letters, and there are all sorts of non-alphabetic characters. For our analysis, we should keep all the letters and spaces (so we can identify distinct words), but we should ignore case and ignore repetition within a word.
# 
# For example, the eighth word of this text is "error." As an _itemset_, it consists of the three unique letters, $\{e, o, r\}$. That is, treat the word as a set, meaning you only keep the unique letters.
# 
# This itemset has three possible _itempairs_: $\{e, o\}$, $\{e, r\}$, and $\{o, r\}$.
# 
# > Since sets are unordered, note that we would regard $\{e, o\} = \{o, e\}$, which is why we say there are only three itempairs, rather than six.
# 
# Start by writing some code to help "clean up" the input.

# **Exercise 1** (`normalize_string_test`: 2 points). Complete the following function, `normalize_string(s)`. The input `s` is a string (`str` object). The function should return a new string with (a) all characters converted to lowercase and (b) all non-alphabetic, non-whitespace characters removed.
# 
# > _Clarification_. Scanning the sample text, `latin_text`, you may see things that look like special cases. For instance, `inci[di]dunt` and `[do]`. For these, simply remove the non-alphabetic characters and only separate the words if there is explicit whitespace.
# >
# > For instance, `inci[di]dunt` would become `incididunt` (as a single word) and `[do]` would become `do` as a standalone word because the original string has whitespace on either side. A period or comma without whitespace would, similarly, just be treated as a non-alphabetic character inside a word _unless_ there is explicit whitespace. So `e pluribus.unum basium` would become `e pluribusunum basium` even though your common-sense understanding might separate `pluribus` and `unum`.
# >
# > _Hint_. Regard as a whitespace character anything "whitespace-like." That is, consider not just regular spaces, but also tabs, newlines, and perhaps others. To detect whitespaces easily, look for a "high-level" function that can help you do so rather than checking for literal space characters.

# 
# For example, `get_normalized_words(latin_text)` will return the following:

# **Exercise 3** (`make_itemsets_test`: 2 points). Implement a function, `make_itemsets(words)`. The input, `words`, is a list of strings. Your function should convert the characters of each string into an itemset and then return the list of all itemsets. These output itemsets should appear in the same order as their corresponding words in the input.
# 
# For example, consider the following:
# 
# ```python
#     make_itemsets(['sed', 'ut', 'perspiciatis', 'unde', 'omnis'])
# ```
# 
# This would return the list,

#  {'d', 'e', 'n', 'u'},
#  {'i', 'm', 'n', 'o', 's'}]
# ```
# 
# > Because sets are unordered, different versions of Python may produce sets with whose element-ordering differs from what you see above. However, the sets themselves should be in this order in the output list, since that is the order in which the corresponding words were given.

# ## Implementing the basic algorithm
# 
# Recall the pseudocode for the algorithm that Rachel and Rich derived together:
# 
# ![FindAssocRules (pseudocode)](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/7635700?private_link=3c473609741895a5cc2c)
# 
# In the following series of exercises, let's implement this method. We'll build it "bottom-up," first defining small pieces and working our way toward the complete algorithm. This method allows us to test each piece before combining them.
# 
# Observe that the bulk of the work in this procedure is just updating these tables, $T$ and $C$. So your biggest implementation decision is how to store those. A good choice is to use a dictionary

# ## Aside: Default dictionaries
# 
# Recall that the overall algorithm requires maintaining a table of item-pair (tuples) counts. It would be convenient to use a dictionary to store this table, where keys refer to item-pairs and the values are the counts.
# 
# However, with Python's built-in dictionaries, you always to have to check whether a key exists before updating it. For example, consider this code fragment:
# 
# ```python
# D = {'existing-key': 5} # Dictionary with one key-value pair
# 
# D['existing-key'] += 1 # == 6
# D['new-key'] += 1  # Error: 'new-key' does not exist!
# ```
# 
# The second attempt causes an error because `'new-key'` is not yet a member of the dictionary. So, a more correct approach would be to do the following:
# 
# ```python
# D = {'existing-key': 5} # Dictionary with one key-value pair
# 
# if 'existing-key' not in D:
#     D['existing-key'] = 0
# D['existing-key'] += 1
#    
# if 'new-key' not in D:
#     D['new-key'] = 0
# D['new-key'] += 1
# ```
# 
# This pattern is so common that there is a special form of dictionary, called a _default dictionary_, which is available from the `collections` module: [`collections.defaultdict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html?highlight=defaultdict#collections.defaultdict).
# 
# When you create a default dictionary, you need to provide a "factory" function that the dictionary can use to create an initial value when the key does *not* exist. For instance, in the preceding example, when the key was not present the code creates a new key with the initial value of an integer zero (0). Indeed, this default value is the one you get when you call `int()` with no arguments:

# In[9]:


print(int())


# In[10]:


from collections import defaultdict

D2 = defaultdict(int) # Empty dictionary

D2['existing-key'] = 5 # Create one key-value pair

D2['existing-key'] += 1 # Update
D2['new-key'] += 1

print(D2)


# **Exercise 4** (`update_pair_counts_test`: 2 points). Start by implementing a function that enumerates all item-pairs within an itemset and updates, _in-place_, a table that tracks the counts of those item-pairs.
# 
# The signature of this function is:
# 
# ```python
#    def update_pair_counts(pair_counts, itemset):
#        ...
# ```
# 
# where you `pair_counts` is the table to update and `itemset` is the itemset from which you need to enumerate item-pairs. You may assume `pair_counts` is a default dictionary. Each key is a pair of items `(a, b)`, and each value is the count. You may assume all items in `itemset` are distinct, i.e., that you may treat it as you would any set-like collection. Since the function will modify `pair_counts`, it does not need to return an object.

# In[11]:


from collections import defaultdict
import itertools # Hint!
from itertools import permutations

def update_pair_counts (pair_counts, itemset):
    """
    Updates a dictionary of pair counts for
    all pairs of items in a given itemset.

    assert type (pair_counts) is defaultdict
    for item in permutations(itemset, 2):
        pair_counts[item]+=1


# In[12]:


# `update_pair_counts_test`: Test cell
itemset_1 = set("error")
itemset_2 = set("dolor")
pair_counts = defaultdict(int)

update_pair_counts(pair_counts, itemset_1)
assert len(pair_counts) == 6
update_pair_counts(pair_counts, itemset_2)
assert len(pair_counts) == 16

print('"{}" + "{}"\n==> {}'.format (itemset_1, itemset_2, pair_counts))
for a, b in pair_counts:
    assert (b, a) in pair_counts
    assert pair_counts[(a, b)] == pair_counts[(b, a)]
    
print ("\n(Passed!)")


# **Exercise 5** (`update_item_counts_test`: 2 points). Implement a procedure that, given an itemset, updates a table to track counts of each item.
# 
# As with the previous exercise, you may assume all items in the given itemset (`itemset`) are distinct, i.e., that you may treat it as you would any set-like collection. You may also assume the table (`item_counts`) is a default dictionary.

# In[13]:


def update_item_counts(item_counts, itemset):

# **Exercise 6** (`filter_rules_by_conf_test`: 2 points). Given tables of item-pair counts and individual item counts, as well as a confidence threshold, return the rules that meet the threshold. The returned rules should be in the form of a dictionary whose key is the tuple, $(a, b)$ corresponding to the rule $a \Rightarrow b$, and whose value is the confidence of the rule, $\mathrm{conf}(a \Rightarrow b)$.
# 
# You may assume that if $(a, b)$ is in the table of item-pair counts, then both $a$ and $b$ are in the table of individual item counts.

# **NOTE:** Passing the preceding test code indicates you are on the right track but does **NOT** guarantee that your solution is completely correct. If you encounter issues later in this notebook, you may need to revisit your approach as part of your debugging process.

# **Exercise 7** (`find_assoc_rules_test`: 3 points). Using the building blocks you implemented above, complete a function `find_assoc_rules` so that it implements the basic association rule mining algorithm and returns a dictionary of rules.

# In particular, your implementation may assume the following:
# 
# 1. As indicated in its signature, below, the function takes two inputs: `receipts` and `threshold`.
# 1. The input, `receipts`, is a collection of itemsets: for every receipt `r` in `receipts`, `r` may be treated as a collection of unique items.
# 2. The input `threshold` is the minimum desired confidence value. That is, the function should only return rules whose confidence is at least `threshold`.
# 
# The returned dictionary, `rules`, should be keyed by tuples $(a, b)$ corresponding to the rule $a \Rightarrow b$; each value should the the confidence $\mathrm{conf}(a \Rightarrow b)$ of the rule.

But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea
of denouncing of a pleasure and praising pain was
born and I will give you a complete account of the
system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human
happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids
pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because
those who do not know how to pursue pleasure
rationally encounter consequences that are extremely
painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or
pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because
it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in
which toil and pain can procure him some great
pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us
ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except
to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any
right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy
a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or
one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant
pleasure?

On the other hand, we denounce with righteous
indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment,
so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the
pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal
blame belongs to those who fail in their duty
through weakness of will, which is the same as
saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These
cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish.
In a free hour, when our power of choice is
untrammeled and when nothing prevents our being
able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to
be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain
circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or
the obligations of business it will frequently
occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and
annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always
holds in these matters to this principle of
selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other
greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to
avoid worse pains.

# **Exercise 11: Your task.** (`basket_rules_test`: 4 points). Your final task in this notebook is to mine this dataset for pairwise association rules. In particular, your code should produce (no pun intended!) a final dictionary, `basket_rules`, that meet these conditions (read carefully!):
# 
# 1. The keys are pairs $(a, b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are item names (as strings).
# 2. The values are the corresponding confidence scores, $\mathrm{conf}(a \Rightarrow b)$.
# 3. Only include rules $a \Rightarrow b$ where item $a$ occurs at least `MIN_COUNT` times and $\mathrm{conf}(a \Rightarrow b)$ is at least `THRESHOLD`.
# 
# Pay particular attention to Condition 3: not only do you have to filter by a confidence threshold, but you must exclude rules $a \Rightarrow b$ where the item $a$ does not appear "often enough." There is a code cell below that defines values of `MIN_COUNT` and `THRESHOLD`, but your code should work even if we decide to change those values later on.
# 
# > _Aside_: Why would an analyst want to enforce Condition 3?
# 
# Your solution can use the `groceries_file` string variable defined above as its starting point. And since it's in the same notebook, you may, of course, reuse any of the code you've written above as needed. Lastly, if you feel you need additional code cells, you can create them _after_ the code cell marked for your solution but _before_ the code marked, `### TEST CODE ###`.
