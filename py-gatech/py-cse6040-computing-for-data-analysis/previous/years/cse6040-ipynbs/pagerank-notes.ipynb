    "**The high-level PageRank idea.** The PageRank algorithm is the offline phase. It is based on a probabilistic model of how a hypothetical user might surf the web, in the absence of any specific query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a somewhat informal description of the model; the details follow in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there are $n$ web pages, represented by a _vertex set_ $V = \\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$. The pages link to one another; let $E$ denote the _edge set_, which is a set of pairs $(i, j)$ indicating that page $i$ points to page $j$. We will sometimes write this link relationship as $i \\rightarrow j$. This representation is also known as a [_directed graph_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph) representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, consider a \"random web surfer.\" This surfer visits web pages one at a time, according to the following stochastic process.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At each time step $t \\geq 0$, the surfer visits a page. Further assume that the surfer's choice of page at time $t+1$ depends only on the page visited at time $t$. (This assumption makes this process a [_discrete-time Markov chain_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain).)\n",
    "2. Initially, at time $t=0$, the web surfer starts on a random page.\n",
    "3. Suppose the surfer is on page $i$ at time $t$. With probability $\\alpha$, the surfer will decide to follow a link going from $i$ to some new page $j$.\n",
    "4. At time $t$, the surfer might instead decide, with probability $1-\\alpha$, to _jump_ to some page $j$. Page $j$ is _not necessarily_ directly connected to $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As time proceeds, the surfer jumps from page to page, sometimes hitting a page it has already visited, and sometimes jumping to an entirely different part of the web graph. Now imagine that the surfer surfs for an _infinitely long time_; what is the probability that the surfer will be on any given page? If this probability distribution can be calculated, then the PageRank idea is to use the distribution to rank the web pages: the most likely page for the surfer to land on is the top-ranked page, the next most likely page is the second-ranked page, and so on."

    "where $x_i(t)$ is the probability that the surfer is on page $i$ at time $t$. Since the surfer must always be on some page, these probabilities must sum to 1: $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i(t) = 1$."

    "Now suppose that the surfer is on page $i$ at time $t$. What page will the surfer visit at time $t+1$? Recall that there are two scenarios in our high-level model: follow an out-link or jump to another page.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Scenario 1._ If the surfer decides to follow an out-link, which one will it choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume the surfer picks an outgoing link uniformly at random. That is, if page $i$ has $d_i$ outgoing links, then let the probability of choosing an out-link be $\\frac{1}{d_i}$. The value $d_i$ is also called the _out-degree_ of vertex $i$. It may be computed by summing each row of $G$, i.e., $d_i \\equiv \\sum_{j=1}^{n} g_{ij}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, given the decision to follow an out-link starting from page $i$, the probability of moving to page $j$ is $p_{ij} \\equiv \\frac{g_{ij}}{d_i}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if page $i$ _has no_ outgoing edges? There are several ways to handle this case. The simple one we will adopt is to _force_ it to have a self-edge, $i \\rightarrow i$. In other words, the surfer has decided to follow an out-link but has nowhere to go; therefore, it stays put on page $i$. Mathematically, the self-edge means $d_i = g_{ii} = 1$ and $p_{ii} = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Aside: This way of handling pages without outgoing edges differs from the way they are treated both in the original PageRank scheme and in Moler's notes. The original PageRank scheme simply removed these pages. By contrast, Moler assumes that when there is no outgoing edge, then the surfer jumps to any random page, just like the $1-\\alpha$ case. In other words, Moler would set all $g_{ij} = 1$ for all $j$ when $i$ has no outgoing links.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given all of the $g_{ij}$, including self-edges when needed, we can express all of these quantities in matrix notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$G \\equiv \\left( g_{ij} \\right),\n",
    " \\qquad D \\equiv \\left(\\begin{array}{ccc} d_1 && \\\\ & \\ddots & \\\\ && d_n \\end{array}\\right),\n",
    " \\qquad P \\equiv \\left( p_{ij} \\right) = D^{-1}G$\n",
    "\n",
    "The matrix $P$ is sometimes called a [probability transition matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_matrix). From the definitions above, you should convince yourself that every row of the matrix $P \\equiv (p_{ij})$ sums to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Scenario 2._ If instead the surfer decides to jump to a random page, which one will it choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, let's assume the surfer jumps uniformly at random to any one of the $n$ pages, which includes itself and any outgoing links from the current page. Then, the probability of choosing any other page $j$ would be just $\\frac{1}{n}$."
