To save some space, you could store just the upper- or lower-triangle. The algorithm would then scan all baskets, and for each basket, increment the counts for all pairs of items in the basket. After reading all baskets, the algorithm could scan the table and pull out the top occurrences. The \"top occurrences\" might be all those that appear more than $s$ times, where $s$ is some threshold."
