    "Solving the normal equations is generally cheaper than performing a QR factorization. However, using QR is more numerically accurate. Algorithms to compute a QR factorization are numerically stable, and solving the system using QR has a lower condition number than solving by using the normal equations. Additionally, applying (multiplying by) an orthogonal matrix is a stable operation."
