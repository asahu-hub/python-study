The topic of this part is a specific type of relational representation sometimes referred to as the _tidy_ (as opposed to _untidy_ or _messy_) form. The concept of tidy data was developed by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/), a statistician and R programming maestro. Much of this lab is based on his tutorial materials (see below).\n",

If our end goal is analysis, then we often want to extract or prepare data in a way that makes analysis easier.\n",

    "## Basic tidying transformations: Melting and casting\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a data set and a target set of variables, there are at least two common issues that require tidying.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, values often appear as columns. Table 4a is an example. To tidy up, you want to turn columns into rows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Gather example](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/images/tidy-9.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this operation takes columns into rows, making a \"fat\" table more tall and skinny, it is sometimes called _melting_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The second most issue is that an observation might be split across multiple rows. Table 2 is an example. To tidy up, you want to merge rows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Spread example](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/images/tidy-8.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this operation is the moral opposite of melting, and \"rebuilds\" observations from parts, it is sometimes called _casting_.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Melting and casting are Wickham's terms from [his original paper on tidying data](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v59/i10/paper). In his more recent writing, [on which this tutorial is based](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html), he refers to the same operation as _gathering_. Again, this term comes from Wickham's original paper, whereas his more recent summaries use the term _spreading_."
