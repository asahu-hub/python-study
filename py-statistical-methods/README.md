Applied Statistics vs Machine Learning

Machine Learning:
    The field of Machine learning is concerned with the question of how to construct computer programs that automatically improve with experience. ML is a subset of AI and concentrates in developing ML Models in order to make predictions, there is a heavy focus on algorithms, code and results. These Learning ML Programs are useful for predictive modeling problems, and some in fact have been borrowed from other fields, such as statistics. Example: Linear Regression.


Statistics:
    The field of Statistics and Applied Statistics is more concerned with understanding data. The process of working with a dataset and developing a predictive model is also a task in statistics. Statistical Learning refers to a set of tools for modeling and undestanding complex datasets. It is a recently developed area in statistics and blends with parallel developments in computer science and, in particular, machine learning.


Predictive Modeling:
    A ML technique that diminishes difference between Statistics and Machine Learning.

Usage of Statistics in Machine Learning:

Following are places in Machine Learning where statistical methods are used.
1. Problem Framing
2. Data Understanding, Cleaning, Selection, Preparation
3. Model Evaluation, Configuration, Selection, PResentation and Predictions.
