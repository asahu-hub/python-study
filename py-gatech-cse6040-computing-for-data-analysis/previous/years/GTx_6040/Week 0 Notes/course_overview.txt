# CSE6040 - Intro to Computational Programming
# Week 0 - Course Review Notes

what is this course about?
what do we need to know now?
what does it take to succeed?

goal:
understand algorithmic and programming techniques needed to build analytics pipeline
- pipeline:
- data (raw inputs) >
- preprocessing the raw data (data cleaning / transformation)
- analyze the data (build a model / EDA)
- present the results (output and visualization = human, more analysis)

pre-requisites:
- programming w/ python or equivalent
- math: calculus, probability, linear algebra

linear algebra:
- pattern mining
- ranking
- regression
- classification
- clustering
- compression
- linear algebra serves as the language between all these algorithms
- matrix = table of data
- relationships between objects (encode real life in mathematical formulas)
- computational = faster with linear algebra

# success in this course:
- learn to think computationally
- practice coding!

# think computationally
- pipeline: inputs > preprocessing > analysis > output
- this is a sequence of stages
- input x -> y (output)
- y = f(x) [take inputs x and output results y]

- computational concerns: what do we ask about the function of x f(x)?
1. is there an algorithm to compute f(x), exactly or approximately?
2. given a program to compute f(x), is it correct?
3. given a correct program, is it efficient?

# write code! practice! hacking!
