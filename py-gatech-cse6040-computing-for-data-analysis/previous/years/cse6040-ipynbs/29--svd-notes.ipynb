    "The main topic of this class was a data analysis method referred to as _Principal Components Analysis_ (PCA). The method requires computing the eigenvectors of a certain matrix; one way to compute those eigenvectors is to use a special factorization from linear algebra called the _Singular Value Decomposition_ (SVD).\n",

    "### Motivation: Data \"compression\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous classes, we've looked at 3 major tasks in data analysis: _regression_, _classification_, and _clustering_. Beyond these, the last problem area you'll consider in our class is what we'll call _compression_.\n",
    "\n",
    "At a high level, the term compression simply refers to finding any compact representation of the data. Such representations can help us in two ways. First, it can make the data set smaller and therefore faster to process or analyze. Secondly, choosing a clever representation can reveal hidden structure."

    "As a concrete example, the specific task we discussed in the last class was one of _dimensionality reduction_: given a $d$-dimensional data set, we wish to transform it into a $k$-dimensional data set where $k \\leq d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the $k$ axes in a clever way might even reveal  structure that is hard to see in all $d$ original dimensions. For instance, look at the 3-D examples at the \"visualizing PCA\" website we looked at during this class, where the first principal component axis reveals 3 sub-clusters: http://setosa.io/ev/principal-component-analysis/"
